Kelly O'Brien is a woman who came home from the U.S. Army to a daughter (Molly) who had grown up without her. When her husband dies, her entire world is focused on saving her daughter from the alien invasion.

# Attitude

Kelly is shown as somewhat passive individual except when it comes to protecting her daughter. Even when a man is threatening her daughter, she is trying to keep him quiet instead of taking Molly away.

Later, when it becomes obvious that there are more than one alien, she begins to take charge. However, when they start to communicate

# Appearance

When she is first introduced to the viewer, Kelly is shown in her army uniform coming home. This is used to set up a back story with the character.

# Abilities

In the beginning, she is portrayed as a defensive character. When a man threatening her daughter is killed by a predator, she is observant enough to discern that picking up the killed man's gun would threaten her. She leaves it behind.

She is also the only one who can fly a helicopter at the end.

# Relationships

From her introduction, Kelly's primary relationship is with her daughter and her husband. These are the first two characters she encounters on screen. Later that evening, when Kelly tries to help put her daughter to bed, her daughter prefers her father. This demonstrates a distance that had grown between herself and her daughter. This distance is also shown as the attempt to bribe her daughter with night vision glasses, which are used later in the plot.

Kelly's relationship with her husband is relatively short in the movie. They are shown to be affectionate, both on the initial greeting and also the discussion about Kelly's distance with her daughter. They are close, but most of the time during that talk after bed is with her husband not looking at her (he's watching TV).

When her husband is attacked by the alien, Kelly grabs her daughter and [runs away](/t/protective-mother/). She doesn't do anything until her husband tells her to run away. Assuming that she had basic training, she seems somewhat passive in her response to a eminent threat to her family. Later, she is still shown running away until another male stops her.

# Sexuality

There is very little sexuality about Kelly in the movie, except for the affection and kissing with her husband.

# History

Very little history is given of the character.
