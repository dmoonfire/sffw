In her [self-titled book](/s/isbn/978-19-3238-622-8/), Artesia is given very little introduction except for a few lines of narrative.

# Attitude

Artesia is represented as having a very [alpha](/t/top-dog/) personality, both as the leader of her personal organization but also how she takes charge of most events that happen around her. She rarely asks for opinions of others.

# Appearance

In the first book, Artesia wears the same black and red armor that consists of chains and plates. The breastplate is [pinup armor](/t/pinup-armor/) with its shaped breasts. In the earlier issues, even though her upper body was armored, her legs and hips were left bare.

# Abilities

Artesia is a competent fighter and horsewoman. She also has magic, inherited from her mother, that allows her to summon spirits to aid her in battle and also knowledge. Later, she gathered the ghosts of her bed sisters.

# Relationships

Inside her military company, Artesia is mostly surrounded by male warriors except for her second-in-command, [Umasza](/c/umasza-of-the-ban-bres/). She is the commander of her company and, therefore, primarily gives orders except when the author is using her conversation for exposition.

Artesia has a close relationship with her "bed sisters" in the king's harem. This includes Lysia, the old woman who manages the harem. Later, when the sisters are kill, they join her as spiritual entities that she uses for the her magic.
