Title: Super Gnat

# Attitude

In the beginning, Super Gnat is shown as taking offense as any job, or perceived joke, about her height. Thought she frequently starts fights, she is also very ineffective at fighting. In one scene, she is being held at bay by someone holding her head.

Later, when Tusk got into a fight on her approach, Phule rebukes her brawling. After that, she no longer flies off the handle on her voice.

She is a cheerful person when not fighting.

# Appearance

Super Gnat is a very short individual and, like most named females in the series, attractive.

# Abilities

Despite her frequent and ineffective brawling, Super Gnat declares that she has multiple belts in martial arts. The reason for her "forgetting" about the belt is because she loses her temper.

She also can take Escrima's stick fighting style and translate it into a competency with fencing.

# Relationships

Super Gnat develops a friendship with Tusk, a non-human in the company.

# Sexuality

Super Gnat is one of the women who joins up in the nude calendar. There is no reference to how she feels about this, thought it is entirely voluntary.

In her back story, she mentions she has (or had) a husband but no children are mentioned.

# History

Super Gnat was the smallest among many brothers. She was teased heavily, which lead to her violent response to short jokes.
