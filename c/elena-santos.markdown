# Attitude

> SSgt. Michael Nantz: Are you ready to use that, Tech Sargent?
>
> TSgt. Elena Santos: With all due respect, Staff Sargent, I didn't get this far on my good looks. I'm ready for payback.

She joins in with sniping because they could use all the help.

# Appearance

Elena's outfit is appropriate for the scene and circumstances. The differences can be attributed to her being Air Force while [the rest of the characters](/t/not-the-same/) are either Marines or Reserves.

# Abilities

Elena is mostly portrayed as [one of the boys](/t/one-of-the-guys/) despite being from a different branch of the military. When she volunteers to help snipe, she proves herself quickly and is encouraged to stay with the others. In the final climax with the alien command ship, she has significant participation in the fight, including some scenes of bravery of her own.

# Relationships

While she is given no back story, there is some demonstration of her proving herself to the other marines with her sniping and combat abilities. After she "proved" herself, her companions appeared to grow more comfortable with her and began to joke and rely on her.

In the end, she is one of the people who joins the main character to go back into the battle. She has much of the same attitude.

# Sexuality

There is little to describe Elena's sexuality. One of her comments ("... didn't get this far...") is one example and also a joke about getting alien goo in her mouth ("... you do that

> TSgt. Elena Santos: I got that nasty stuff all over my mouth, man.
>
> Marine laughs.
>
> TSgt. Elena Santos: That's not funny!
>
> Marine: You let him do you on the first date.

# History

Little history is given in the movie since it focuses on a relatively short period of time during an alien invasion.
