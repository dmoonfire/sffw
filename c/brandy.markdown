# Attitude

She is portrayed as a pessimist, dour and insulting. She has terms for the various members of the company such as "wimps". Later, [Rembrant](/c/rembrant/) is tasked with working on her language, but there are no details about any change in attitude during the first novel.

# Appearance

Brandy is described as being a large woman in her early introductions, but with Robert Asprin's terse descriptions, it isn't exactly clear if she is overweight or voluptuous until later when a holographer is "appreciating" her curves.

# Abilities

Beyond character development, there are not many times when Brandy is shown to have many abilities. She gives orders and participates in the nude pin-up. In one scene, she fights with Tusk and wins, but it is almost entirely off-screen.

# Relationships

As the top sergeant, Brandy is the highest, non-commissioned officer in the company. She is shown as being loud and commanding, but otherwise respected by the group. When she tells a story in the beginning, everyone is listening and the other veterans are agreeing with her predictions.

# Sexuality

Brandy is one of the women who joined in the nude calendar that [Rose](/c/rose/) suggestions in the company. She is cheerful about being seen in the buff including making a comment about her breasts looking good compared to the "newer models".

There is also one scene where she is wading through mud "looking like the Bismark" coming to port.

Other than relatively light references, there is little plot related to Brandy's sexuality. 

# History

The character's history before joining is not given in the first novel.
