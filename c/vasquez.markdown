Vasquez is a private in the Colonial Marines in the movie [Aliens](/s/tmdb/679/).

# Attitude

# Appearance

In her physical appearance, there is little difference between Vasquez and the appearances of the other marines. In many ways, she is [one of the guys](/t/one-of-the-guys/) except that she has a two-piece outfit while in cold sleep instead of the shorts that the other males wear.

# Abilities

# Relationships

The relationship Vasquez has with the rest of the marines is a close, friendly relationship. It shows in the ribbing between her and Hudson, the playful pull-ups contest after cold sleep, and even her final line before her death by grenade.

> Vasquez: You always were an asshole, Gorman! 

# Sexuality

Since this is an action move, there is very little time to develop Vasquez as a character beyond shooting and killing. In plot, there is only one spoken reference to her gender:

> Hudson: Hey Vasquez, have you ever been mistaken for a man? 
>
> Vasquez: No. Have you? 

None of the other male marines make any comment on gender, either theirs or other marines.
