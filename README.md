# Fighting Women

At [WisCon 2013](http://wiscon.info), I (Dylan R. E. Moonfire) am scheduled to be on a panel entitled [The Female Soldier in Science Fiction and Fantasy](http://wiscon.piglet.org/program/detail?idItems=2032).

> Science Fiction and Fantasy have long been telling stories about female soldiers and veterans, from Eowyn and Alanna, to "Aliens"'s Vasquez and "Firefly's Zoe," to comic book heroines like Batwoman and Captain Marvel. How do these portrayals explore the role of women in wartime, and in the professional military? Do tropes about female soldiers need to evolve as more women than ever take on military roles worldwide? Conversely, can speculative fiction about women and military service help to change the popular image of the contemporary soldier, which often reflects an exclusively male experience?

While I consider myself fairly wide-read, I figured it wouldn't hurt to document a bit of the research for this topic. That way, I won't sound quite as braind-dead as I feared.

## Style and Contributors

The characters and references will focus on military solidiers and perceptions of them. Not everyone may agree, but I feel that eventually it will come down to a specific tone and style that is appropriate for this type of information.

I am basing this off [TV Troupes](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomePage) both in the informality and tone. I'm just not using a wiki-software because I think Git is a good way of managing these type of things.

Please use the [Github Issues](https://github.com/dmoonfire/fighting-women/issues) for corrections, expansions, or details. Feel free to fork and expand on the details and then issue a pull request.

## Presentation

This site is written entirely Markdown. There will be an external project to render and display it for a website or viewing. This will keep the data (this site) separate from the presentation. I also intent this to have a consistent file format to make it parsable into metadata for later use.
